There are Two types of files in computer world
1.)Binary File
 -> compose of bit
 -> make for specific type of software
 -> output file of complier
 -> not readable, not for human
 ie1 tar file -> arheive files -> binary file
    analysize or used by software of "tar"
 ie1 java create bype code files -> we call immediate files -> not good example of binanry files

 Two ways to make distinsion to see what type of binary files
 1.) by extentsion ie. .exe .zip
 2.) by "magic number" 
     file header (256 bytes 0-255) most can be ignore except "MAGIC NUMBER" -> we call it "file ID" -> located norally first two words of any binary file-> file will be collasp if the first two words was changed -> what hacker do

     magic number was invented by the software developer -> should be unique
     can chekc on "ANSI", magic(5)-> man -5 magic to see all the magic rules

     "tar -cuf abcd.tar ." -> arheive all files
     "gzip abcd.tar" -> compress the archeive

      combine these two steps
      "tar -zcup abcd.tar" search for those tar header to zip
      know it was zipped for zip header


 2.)Text File -> human & machine readable
              -> interview question
              Text files -> This is ok 11 bytes
              binary files has small size than text file
              advantage of text files -> human readable -> xml is text file
              need to add -> "meta data" -> data that make that line more meaningful
              <b> This is ok </b>
              xml is using text + meta data
              Hyper Text Markup Language -> Hyper -> moving the point of cursor, action happened
              
****Difference between html and xml***
1.)html -> does not care upper/ lower case
ie html is accepted by html but not xml
<person>
    <user name=John age=25/>
    <user name=Alex age=25/>
</person>


acepted by xml, 2.)all key word (attributes) within " "
<person>
    <user name="John" age="25"/>
    <user name="Alex" age="25"/>
</person>

3.) each tag element in html have a meaning <H3> Hello </H3> H3 has meaning -> html will give big font
In boswer default, put html put to broswer-> show website; put xml ->put to broswer colorised mode
all of modern broswer are responsive to html and xml. 

XML
1.)writing element in lower case
HTML
1.)writing element in upper case

HTML + XML = XHTML(not popular, short life cycle, not work properly)

XML Style Sheet -> instruction give to broswer that how to handle XML
                -> written in XML
chrome://global/content/xml/XMLPrettyPaint.xsl -> able to modify it

XML=Extensible Markup Language -> not good name
XML would be used in both server side and client side
Java has XML in server side -> configuration file -> in text format
some config file has no standard

***CONFIGURATION FILES***
""" not standardize format configuration file
os=Unix
size-15M
//This is just a wrong Number 
"""

ant(another need tool) written by XML-> replaced by gradle compling android application Gradle is wriiten by Groovy (simple java), androids use "XML" configuration files

P(System.getPropertiy("ios.name")) -> name of property
java 9 release -> jshell -> REPL -> revolved print loop -> cannot handle graphic 
maven written by XML

Procedue to create XML files
1.) Validate XML files
2.) Extract data from XML
    JAVA had both API for extract data in XML
	a.) DOM -> put entire XML in memory -> good: simple -> bad: too much memory
	b.) SAX -> put individual part in XML -> good: less memory

Chapter 1 -> covered all coover tognight
Next week -> Chapter 2  -> how to validate XML
